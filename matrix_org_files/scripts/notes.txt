JQuery files are misleading

jquery.js = 
jquery_002.js = magnific_popup
jquery_003.js = 
jquery_004.js = FitVid
jquery_005.js = PieChart
jquery_006.js = mobile - keep for now

Fonts
both css.css and css_002.css load fonts and style.css uses them

I removed the font call from style.css as it was needed for the legend to work
